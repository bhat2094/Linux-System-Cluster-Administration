Virtual Machine (VirtualBox) and Server Installation and Configuration (NIS, NFS, DHCP, and DNS)

Here, we will go over the complete process of installing and running a network system.
There will be three virtual machines in the VirtualBox. One of them is the server, and the other two are the clients.
The overview of the project is as follows:

1. Install and setup the virtual machines within the VirtualBox
2. Install and configure the NIS server and NIS clients
3. Install and configure the NFS server and NFS clients
4. Install and configure the DHCP server and DHCP clients
5. Install and configure the DNS server and DNS clients

I also included some useful commands and techniques for troubleshooting networking issues.
